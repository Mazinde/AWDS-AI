# AWDS-AI
 Automated Weed Detection System using computer vision and machine learning for precision agriculture.

Welcome to the AWDS AI Github repository!.AWDS AI (Automated Weed Detection System) is an innovative, AI-powered agricultural software solution that harnesses computer vision technology to detect and manage weed infestations in crop fields. By analyzing footage from surveillance cameras, AWDS AI enables farmers to precision-manage their fields like never before.


Structure

This repository is structured as follows:
-Server/:- This directory contains the backend code, including API endpoints and Database models (using Django) and they are implimented using python and django it also contains the requirements.txt file for all the libraries used in the project.

-Client/:This directory contains the frontend code of the system.It is implimented using Python Qt5 designer framework,Html and Css and python.It also contains the trained model for the AWDS AI that will be used when the monitoring interface is started.  

Purpose

This repository serves as a collaborative hub for the development and enhancement of the AWDS AI platform. By making it publicly accessible, we encourage community involvement, enabling developers, contributors, and users to explore the code, identify areas for improvement, and propose new features.

AWDS AI(Automated Weed Detection System) is an AI-powered agricultural software solution that leverages computer vision technology to detect and manage weed infestations in crop fields. By analyzing footage from surveillance cameras installed in agricultural fields, AWDS provides farmers with:
- Accurate weed detection and classification.
- Precise location and mapping of weed infestations.
- Real-time alerts sent to farmers' dashboards, providing timely notifications of weed detections.
- Monitoring and tracking of weed growth and treatment effectiveness.
